Change Log
========================================================================================
[0] Added a download link to the Save Data screen to allow the test raw data to be downloaded as a CSV directly.
    Following a recent security patch, data URIs can't be opened in a new window by JS, breaking the origional method.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Reordered the form page text boxes to include details of the study grouped first
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] Removed the max-height limit to allow the scaling for the form pages (old limit - 600px)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Changed the Firefox warning to only show if Firefox is not being used. The identification of Firefox is done using ducktyping
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4] Added the ability to pre-populate certain fields form a URL query. This is done with the following formatting:

    "index.html?ID=12&sessionNumber=1&studyID=4&groupID=7"

    This will be stored in the session storage and redirect to the main.html page. The values from the URL will be used to pre-populated the textboxes on the form.
    Those textboxes will then be marked as read-only to prevent those taking the test from changing these values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5] Removed the 'clear' button from the form, as this cleared the read-only fields and is not really needed when using the new system.
