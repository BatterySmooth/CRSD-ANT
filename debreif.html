		<h2 class="centered">Thank you for taking part in this study</h2>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>This study investigates the effects of camouflaging social difficulties associated with social interactions on cognitive measures including traits of mental health. Increased use of camouflaging behaviours has been associated with increase anxiety and depression (Hull et al., 2021). Behaviours which attempt to hide autistic traits have been described as cognitively demanding (Livingston et al., 2020) which may lead to cognitive fatigue. Cognitive fatigue has been associated with alterations in cognitive, behavioural and emotional physiological responses (Ream & Richardson, 1996). This study aimed to assess whether personality traits associated with autism resulted in differences in performance on cognitive tasks over time.</p>
		<h2>COVID-19</h2>
		<p>If you develop COVID-19 related symptoms <b><u>within 48 hours</u></b> of attending this experiment please contact the researcher immediately to inform them. This will help us to minimise the spread and ensure we can keep people as safe as possible. Your name and contact number will be collected electronically in encrypted software and kept separate from the research data to allow us to make contact with you should you have encountered someone who tested positive for COVID-19. This data will be deleted after 21 days.</p>
    <h2>Your Data</h2>
		<p>All person identifiable information you have provided will be stored in an encrypted folder on a secure server at the University of Bath. Once you have completed the lab session all person identifiable information will be destroyed and your data will be fully anonymous. If you wish to withdraw your data you may do so up to the point of completing the lab session, as after this point we will not be able to identify it as yours. The anonymous data will be stored on a secure drive at the University of Bath and only be accessible to researchers and will be stored for a period of 10 years. Your data will only be used for the purpose of research and may be used in future research projects. Any presentation or publication of the data you have provided will not include identifying information.</p>
